# Pen-Testing-App-Ver2

This is a second build of a penetration testing app I've developed that is meant to automate a variety of the different tools I've written. The interface only includes code that has been fully tested thoroughly. Any others, feel free to browse and look at it. You won't see it in the interface but it's there in case you wish to see it. The following to look at first are:

   * Bash_Interface.py (This is the main interface)

   * LinuxInstall.py (Installs all needed components, including PYQ5 in case you don't have it installed. Also compatible with windows via pip installer)

   * Installer Module.sh(Script that will install all needed compilers for Linux should you not have them installed)
